## Introduction
cut-and-together is a collection of Python scripts that allow you to create collages by cutting an input image into smaller cropped images and then combining those cropped images into a single output image. The scripts utilize the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate and process the images.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
## sage
1. Cutting the Input Image
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install PIL using pip:

``` codecopy
pip install pillow
```
Place the input image you want to cut in the same directory as the cut.py script. Make sure the input image is in a supported format, such as PNG or JPEG.
Open the cut.py script in a text editor or IDE.

Modify the following variables in the script according to your requirements:

input_image_path: Path to the input image file.
output_width: Width of the output cropped images in pixels.
output_height: Height of the output cropped images in pixels.
output_dir: Path to the output directory where the cropped images will be saved.
Save the modified script.

Run the script using Python:

```ã€€codecopy
python cut.py
```

The script will cut the input image into smaller cropped images based on the specified width and height. The cropped images will be saved in the specified output directory. Each cropped image will be named in the format row-column.png, indicating its position in the original image.

2. Creating the Collage
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install PIL using pip:

Copy code
pip install pillow
Place the cropped images you want to use in a folder. The folder should only contain the cropped images you want to include in the collage.

Open the together.py script in a text editor or IDE.

Modify the following variables in the script according to your requirements:

input_folder: Path to the folder containing the cropped images.
output_width: Width of the output collage image in pixels.
output_height: Height of the output collage image in pixels.
resolution: Resolution of the output collage image in dots per inch (DPI).
rows: Number of rows in the collage.
columns: Number of columns in the collage.
Save the modified script.

Run the script using Python:

Copy code
python together.py
The script will create the collage by combining the cropped images and save it as multiple output images. Each output image will contain a portion of the collage. The output images will be named as output_1.png, output_2.png, and so on.
